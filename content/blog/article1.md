# NoOps is the new normal

The reality is that DevOps is over... Well not exactly, but it certainly
has some stiff competition.

NoOps is the new path, whereby we leverage someone else's
computers to do our infrastructure, but better than that
we don't even manage those resources, letting the provider
handle that (e.g. GKE on Google auto-updating the ContainerOS
systems).

Welcome to the new normal.
